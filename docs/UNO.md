# UNO – Classic Rules (Markdown Edition)

## Overview
UNO is a shedding-type card game for 2–10 players. First player to 500 points (or a house-ruled target) wins.  
Players race to get rid of all their cards by matching the top card of the discard pile by **color** or **number/symbol**. Strategic play (and shameless spite) encouraged.

## Components
- **108 cards total**:
  - **Number cards** (0–9 in four colors: Red, Yellow, Green, Blue)
  - **Action cards** (per color):
    - Skip (2 per color)
    - Reverse (2 per color)
    - Draw Two (+2) (2 per color)
  - **Wild cards**:
    - Wild (4)
    - Wild Draw Four (+4) (4)

---

## Setup
1. Shuffle the deck thoroughly.
2. Each player draws one card; highest number deals.
3. Dealer gives **7 cards** to each player.
4. Place the remaining deck face-down as the draw pile.
5. Flip the top card to start the discard pile:
   - If it’s an **Action card**, apply it as if it were played by the dealer (Wilds let dealer choose color).

## Game Play
Players take turns clockwise (unless reversed).

### On Your Turn:
You must play **one card** from your hand that matches the top discard by:
- **Color** (e.g., blue card on blue card)
- **Number** (e.g., any “5” on any “5”)
- **Symbol** (e.g., Skip on Skip)
- **Wild** (change color anytime)

If you can’t play:
- Draw 1 card from the draw pile.
- If you can play it immediately, you may.
- Otherwise, your turn ends.

## Action Cards
- **Skip** – Next player loses their turn.
- **Reverse** – Changes direction of play.
- **Draw Two (+2)** – Next player draws 2 cards and loses turn.
- **Wild** – Player chooses the next color.
- **Wild Draw Four (+4)** – Player chooses the next color, and next player draws 4 cards and loses turn.
  - Can only be played if you have **no cards** matching the current color (numbers don’t matter).  
    If challenged and you were bluffing, you must draw 4 instead.

---

## Special Rules
- **UNO Call** – When you have one card left, you must yell “UNO!” before the next player starts their turn.
  - Fail, and you must draw 2 penalty cards if caught.
- **Draw Pile Exhaustion** – If the draw pile runs out, shuffle the discard pile (leave top card) to form a new draw pile.
- **No Card to Play** – If you can’t play even after drawing, pass your turn.

## House Rules Variants (Optional)
- **Stacking** – Allow stacking Draw Twos and Wild Draw Fours on matching cards to pass the pain along.
- **Progressive UNO** – Draw Two on Draw Two forces next player to draw 4, etc.
- **Seven-Zero Rule** – Play a “7” to swap hands with any player; play a “0” to rotate hands in play direction.

Yes, it’s just a card game, but in practice it’s a highly-engineered friendship stress test.
