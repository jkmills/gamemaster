## Components  
- **94 cards total**:
  - Number cards:
    - 1× “1”, 2× “2”, … up to 12× “12” (plus a single “0” card) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
  - **Action cards** (9 total): *Flip Three*, *Freeze*, *Second Chance* :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

---

## Game Setup  
1. Shuffle the deck.  
2. Choose a dealer.  
3. Dealer deals one card face-up to each player, resolving any Action cards as they appear before continuing. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## Turn Structure  
- Starting with the dealer, each active player chooses to **Hit** (draw another card) or **Stay** (bank points, drop from round). :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- **If Hit**:
  - Draw the top card:
    - If it's a **number card**: place face-up. If it's a **duplicate** of one you already have, you **bust**—score 0 this round and you're out. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
    - If it's your **7th unique number**, you score it and an immediate **+15 bonus**, and the round ends for everyone. Naturally. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
    - If it's an **Action** or **Modifier** card: resolve or place as required (see below). :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

---

## Action Cards Explained  
- **Freeze**: Targeted player banks their current points and is out for the round. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- **Flip Three**: Target must draw three cards in sequence. Duplicates still bust you. If another action appears while drawing, it resolves *after* the three draws—or after a bust. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- **Second Chance**: Stash it. If you bust with a duplicate, discard the duplicate *and* this card instead of busting. Only one can be held—extra ones must be passed on or discarded. Discard all at round end. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

> If you're the only active player left, you get to play any Action cards on yourself. Because why not? :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

---

## Modifiers & Scoring  
1. **Sum number cards** you end with.  
2. Apply **×2**, if you have it (only multiplies number cards—not bonus or modifiers). :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
3. Add any **+2/+4/+6/+8/+10** modifiers.  
4. If you achieved the **Flip 7** (seven unique numbers), tack on **+15 bonus**. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

---

## End of Round & Game  
- When **all** players have either busted or chosen to stay, or someone hits Flip 7, the round ends. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
- Discard played cards; unused deck passes left to a new dealer. When deck runs dry, shuffle discards. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  
- Game ends when **someone reaches 200+ points** at end of a round. If tied, keep playing until there's a winner. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}
