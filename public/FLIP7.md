## Turn Sequence

1. **Deal One Card Each:** Dealer deals one card face-up to each player (including themselves). Resolve any Action cards immediately.
2. **Player Actions:** On your turn, choose to:

   * **Hit**: Draw another card and place it face-up.
   * **Stay**: End your participation for the round and bank your points.
3. Continue until all players have stayed, busted, or someone flips 7 unique Number cards.

## Busting

* You bust if you draw a Number card with a value you already have.
* Action and Modifier cards do not cause busts.
* If you bust, you score 0 points for that round.

## Action Cards

* **Freeze!** — Target player banks points and is out of the round.
* **Flip Three!** — Target player draws three cards in a row, resolving them in order. Bust or Flip 7 ends this sequence early.
